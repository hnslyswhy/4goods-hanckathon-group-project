## Team Members

[Miriam Nakiyingi](https://github.com/miriamnaki): 
I worked on front end setup and the profile page that needed to use JWT tokens for authentication, multiple API calls to the back end to display data. I enjoyed working on the team and learned more about mongoDB and jwt tokens.

[Phoebe Chang](https://github.com/phoebe03111) : 
I worked on designing, making prototype, mostly focused on front-end side of the project. I also incorporated Google Maps API to display a map on the website.

[Huanyu Wang](https://github.com/hnslyswhy):
I worked on the backend, connecting backend with database MongoDB, and the signup, login and logout components in the frontend. It's a great learning opportunity for me to learn about how to use JTW for auth and cooperate with my team to get the backend and database setup properly.

[Carol Deweger](https://github.com/CDeweger) : 
I worked on the front-end using React.js, set up the image upload function with Cloudinary, I also did the initial research, collecting data. And I use Sass for stylings. I am passionate about poverty alleviation. I want to use my programming skill to make a positive impact in my community.
