              4Goods is a platform that brings different non-profit
              organizations and donors together. It is a common issue that
              donations are not efficiently distributed and used. On 4Goods, any
              non-profit can easily create posts for surplus donations or items
              that are needed. By sharing surplus donations, non-profits can
              efficiently share and distribute their resources while limiting or
              preventing food waste. Donation Hub can also help donors find what
              to donate and match them with organizations in need. I hope you
              will enjoy Donation Hub and find it useful. Happy sharing and
              happy donating!
